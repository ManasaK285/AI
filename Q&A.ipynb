If June wanted to watch soap operas, Suzie wanted to watch talk shows. Tensions rose to the point that the girls could no longer stand one anotherâ€™s company. It seemed that they had nothing in common, until the day that progress reports went home. On the bus the girls were startled by how upset the other looked. They realized that they were both failing a subject. Suzie was failing math and June was failing reading. Since both girls wanted to pass their classes, they agreed to help one another. So after school for the next few weeks, Suzie tutored June in reading and then June tutored Suzie in math. By the time report cards were distributed, Suzie and June were passing all their classes. The girls were delighted, but their mother was happiest of all. Not just because her daughters had passed their classes, but because they learned to be good sisters. (#source:ereadingworksheets)\n",

His mother tried to teach him the value of getting an education and having a backup plan. But Victor would respond the same way every time, \"Mom, I won't need to know any of that boring old stuff when I'm famous. You'll see.\" There was one major problem with Victor's plan: he wasn't any good at singing. Victor enjoyed singing so much that he didn't notice the pained look on the faces of those who endured his singing. Some lied to him and said they liked his singing. Other people told him to find something else to do with his life. Victor accused those people of being \"jealous haters\" and ignored their advice. Soon Victor dropped out of high school to focus on his music career. The years passed and the doors never opened. (#source:ereadingworksheets)\n",
